| RISK                           | PROBABILITY | IMPACT |
|--------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Hardware failure               | 50%         | 4      |
| Incompetent workers/programmer | 40%         | 2      |
| System failure                 | 70%         | 3      |
| Human error                    | 40%         | 1      |

Resiko yang sangat berpotensi adalah

Formula is RE = PxC

P = the probability of occurrence for a risk

C = the cost to the project should the risk actually occur

P = 50% probabilty that 10 of 20 software component will have problems

C = Total Cost of developing 10 components is Rp.90.000.000

RE = PXC = 0.5X Rp.90.000.000 = Rp.45.000.000
